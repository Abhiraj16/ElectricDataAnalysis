**Electric Vehicle Data Analysis - Classification & Regression Models**

This project explores electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset of EV registrations in Washington state, I applied classification and regression models to predict key attributes such as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility and Base MSRP. The analysis includes extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to optimize predictive performance.

**Key Features:**

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding EV adoption patterns.
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Perceptron, NaÃ¯ve Bayes) for predicting CAFV eligibility.
- Regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees) for price prediction.
- Handling missing data and class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Performance evaluation through accuracy, precision, recall, and RÂ² metrics.
